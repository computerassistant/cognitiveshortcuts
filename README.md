# Cognitive Shortcuts
A collection of Siri Shortcuts infused with artificial intelligence

# Assistant
Train and publish a LUIS.ai app that contains "Intents", filled with sample "Utterances", that correspond to the shortcuts in your library. 

### How it works
Assistant passes your dictated text to your LUIS app. LUIS processes the text and returns the name of the Intent. The intent and the shortcut should have the same name. Assistant then runs the appropriate shortcut. This effectively acts as a secondary "Add to Siri" option with the benefit of being able to use multiple utterances, mitigating the cognitive load it takes to recall the exact phrase.

There are no secondary servers. All communication is between LUIS.ai and the Siri shortcut.
